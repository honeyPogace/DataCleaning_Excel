<h2>Description</h2>
This project is intended to showcase my knowledge in Excel using standard data cleaning techniques and data visualization charts and pivot tables.Click on the link to the excel datasheet for a closer look and view the interactive dashboard.

<h2>Common Data Cleaning Best Practices</h2>

- Removing Duplicates: Use Excel's "Remove Duplicates" feature to eliminate duplicate records from your dataset. Removing outliers in your data that could skew your data and visualization charts.

- Handling Missing Values: Identify and handle missing values appropriately.

- Cleaning data by removing leading/trailing spaces, converting text to proper case, removing special characters, and standardizing text values. Excel functions like TRIM(), PROPER(), and CLEAN() and Find and Replace are useful.

- Standardize data formats to ensure consistency. For example, ensure that all dates are in the same format, all measurements use the same units, and categorical variables use consistent naming conventions.

- Use Excel's "Format Cells" feature to change data types as required.


<h2>Excel Formulas Used</h2>

- <b>XLOOKUP, TRIM, PROPER, IF</b>
