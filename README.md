<h1>Data Cleaning and Visualization using Microsoft Excel</h1>

<h2>Excel Dataset</h2>

[Excel Data Project](https://github.com/honeyPogace/DataCleaning_Excel/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx)



<h2>Description</h2>
This project is intended to showcase my knowledge in Excel using standard data cleaning techniques and data visualization charts and pivot tables.Click on the link to the excel datasheet for a closer look and view the interactive dashboard.

<h2>Common Data Cleaning Best Practices</h2>

- Removing Duplicates: Use Excel's "Remove Duplicates" feature to eliminate duplicate records from your dataset. Removing outliers in your data that could skew your data and visualization charts.

- Handling Missing Values: Identify and handle missing values appropriately.

- Cleaning data by removing leading/trailing spaces, converting text to proper case, removing special characters, and standardizing text values. Excel functions like TRIM(), PROPER(), and CLEAN() and Find and Replace are useful.

- Standardize data formats to ensure consistency. For example, ensure that all dates are in the same format, all measurements use the same units, and categorical variables use consistent naming conventions.

- Use Excel's "Format Cells" feature to change data types as required.



<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<h3>Data Formatting and Cleaning</h3>
 <br/>
 
 - First and foremost, removed Duplicate IDs from the dataset. Find and Replace feature used to replace letters such as "S" to Single and "M" to Married. Other functions not depicted that were used were TRIM, and PROPER. Formatting certain values, such as "Income", to establish congruency with the data using Transform feature. An "Age Range" column was added to give better clarity when creating visualizations.

- <h3>Data Visualization using Pivot Tables<h3/>
 <br/>
 
- Multiple pivot tables were created to establish some insight into decision making.

<h3>Excel Data Project Dashboard Overview<h3/>
 <br/>
 
- Created a simple dashboard to showcase the pivot tables and included some utility in the form of splicers to filter through relevant data.
